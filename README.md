PIXL 2 is an application that allows the user to select grid section and modify its color to create a piece of pixel art. Users will be able to save and display their artwork on a gallery page via local storage.

## Problem Domain & Solution

PIXL 2 is an app designed as a fun tool for escaping the stress of existing in 2022. We wanted our app to be simple and user-friendly while still having the tools necessary to create something unique and exciting.
